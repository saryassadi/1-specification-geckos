Simon:
As a user who wants to build habits with friends together, I want to see if my friends are keeping their habits everyday too, so that I can have some extra motivation to keep up the habit too.

As a user, I want the app to have an actual validation system (automated/manual) to check if I actually complete the tasks daily, so that I cannot just get away with not doing the tasks but tricked the app to think that I did.

**As a user**, I want the app to only notify me to drink water instead of forcing me to drink water, because I'm the type of person who would only forget to drink water and I do not want to be pushed.

As a supervisor, I want to receive a notification when a user oversees to log the habit, so I can review it accordingly.

As a supervisor, I want to approve or reject a logged habit (e.g., drinking water) based on proof provided, so the daily task is actually done. `Would this be too much of a control freak?`

As a user and a supervisor, I want the app interface to be clean and easy to use, so that people who are not so proficient with using smart phones can still track their habits, like seniors.

As a user and a supervisor, I want to toggle between my personal tracker and my supervisor dashboard, so I can manage my own habits and others' without logging out.

As a supervisor, I want to leave (positive) comments after verifying a habit, so I can provide emotional support to the user.

As a supervisor, I want an "Overview" screen for all my supervisees, so I can quickly see who is keeping their habits up and who needs help.

As a supervisor, I want to see a "days since last completion" counter on my dashboard for each supervisee, so I can identify who is currently struggling to maintain their habit.
