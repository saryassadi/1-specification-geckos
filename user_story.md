**This is just a temporary user-stories working place, we will copy-paste this to README.**
As a user, I want to be notified of drinking water, so I can have a good habit of drinking water.
As a user, I want to choose from a list of habits, so I can quickly start habit tracking
As a user, I want to mark a habit as being complete or incomplete, so I can check whether I have completed the daily habit.
As a user, I want to see a counter showing the number of consecutive days of habit completion, so I feel sense of accomplishment. 
As a user, I want to see the percentage of the goal I accomplished until now, so I know what I need to do to complete the habit.
As a user, I want to receive digital medal or badge when I hit the milestone, so I can be motivated to maintain my habits.


As a user, I want to be notified how those habits are benefiting me.


Simon:
As a user who wants to build habits with friends together, I want to see if my friends are keeping their habits everyday also, so that I can have some extra motivation to keep up the habit too.
As a user, I want the app to have an actual validation system to check if I actually complete the tasks daily, so that I cannot just get away with not doing the tasks but tricked the app to think that I did.
**As a user**, I want the app to only notify me to drink water instead of forcing me to drink water, because I'm the type of person who would only forget to drink water and I do not want to be pushed.
